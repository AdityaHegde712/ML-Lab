    "## Design 2D CNN Classification\n",
    "### 1. One existing standard dataset from \"NHIST\", CIFAR10, CIFAR100, NHIST-Fashion\n",
    "### 2. Second should be a custom dataset (you design your own by taking pics from mobile or something, any multi-classification problem). Apply data augmentation, increase overall samples, apply same CNN model on this. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sub-tasks:\n",
    "1. Comparative study with different hyperparameters (learning rate, epochs, batch size, optimizer, activation function, convo layer numbers, regularizer/dropout). Also train acc, train loss, val acc, val loss. \n",
    "2. Have a plot of accuracies and losses. \n",
    "3. Use CSVLogger class from keras if tensorflow"
